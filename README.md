# Space Explorers

[Space Explorers](https://alextownson.github.io/space-explorers/) is one of the first web projects I ever designed and developed. It is a maze game inspired by one of my favourite arcade games Asteroids. 

## Design and Development

When I made this project in 2019, I had only learned the bare minimum HTML and CSS to get going with JavaScript. I did not properly plan and design the game to work on various devices or screen sizes. I have since added a temporary media query to indicate that this game is not playable on smaller screens. 

## Space Explorers v2.0 (coming soon)

My intention is to make Space Explorers mobile compatible by using some of the skills I learned in another project, [Black Box](https://github.com/alextownson/black-box). This project uses the phone's gyroscope to control an instrument with motion. I would like to do the same with the ship in Space Explorers and allow the players to control the ship by moving their phone.
